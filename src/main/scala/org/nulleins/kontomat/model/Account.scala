/**
 * Aggregate definition for account
 * <p/>
 * Responsibilities include representation of the current state of an account,
 * implementing business rules/logic on receipt of change events, publishing
 * any state changes to interested parties (pub/sub) and recreating itself 
 * from a sequence of historical events (projection)
 * 
 * What do we know about accounts?
 * They have a type (e.g., eWallet), they can be internal or external, they have an owner,
 * they probably have an account currency
 * They are 'instances' of an Account product, that may supply some of the processing rules,
 * such as limits, but some limits will be instance-specific
 * Accounts have a life-cycle, from created, thru open, suspended, resumed, closed, deleted
 * Accounts can have detail updated (perhaps limits changed)
 * Transfers would seem to be the main business activity involving accounts: value is transfered and
 * and out, and these transactions would be the main usage scenarios
